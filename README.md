# MFMP-SUCK
MFMP Replication of nuclear siphon device.

- Unless new information comes to light about the operation of a working device then the verdict here are the claims do not hold water. 

## Goals

- [failed] Quickly determine if we can move any volume of water with the process described in the paper.
- [failed] Discover a set of construction parameters and share with community.
- [] Collate discovered parameters from the community.

## Implementation

- One way Check valve, become hand driven startup pump.
- 1/2" Venturi where bubbles can form and collapse thus adding nuclear flow.
- 15mm PEX pipe and fittings.

### Attempts

#### First 

![Attempt1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/330871e5-4e81-42a1-b889-cc2497ada457)

So the biggest failure is the pumping mechanism, there was inadequate flow (Trickle that stops), The check valves tried was a standard mains plumbing type from [flowmaster](https://www.screwfix.com/p/flomasta-single-check-valve-22mm/61237) So I switched to a Garden Hose type of check valve which did allow some pumping. 
The next problem was the leaks around the venturi which were only observed when priming off the mains pressure.
To Try Next, would be to build a better hand driven pump that can move a greater volume. 
The other idea to try would be a sump pump and then turning this off to see if the flow can continue, however I normally have the venturi very close to the pump under water, I would need to place the check valve between the pump and venturi.

#### Second

Using some 22mm pipe and a marble and some seals another check valve was fabricated, The pumping was easier but still in the trickle range, So decided to go down the auxiallary pump route since it required too much effort to hand crank the pump. With improved seals and no leaks with end tap closed and auxillary pump on, the run was looking good, except Pump off flow stops! 
Is the valve leaking too much?, is it too slow? 
Do we have enough pressure to drive the venturi. 

## Alternatives

- Plants/Trees
- Capillary/Wick Action (Very slow method of moving water)
- Ram Pumps (Requires a flow of water and Wastes more than it pumps)
- Venturi based emergency pumps (Requires mains pressure to drive vacuum for basement siphon)
